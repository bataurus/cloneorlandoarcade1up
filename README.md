## Arcade1up scripts

One to use the original Power and Volume buttons of your modded Arcade1Up machine? These scripts will help you do it.

Just `ssh` into your Pi and run the below,

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orlandovald/arcade1up/master/setup.sh)
```
The script will install all the required dependencies, will clone this repo and configure the scripts to be executed during startup.
